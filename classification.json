The article does not provide any contradictory evidence to refute this claim.\"\n}\n\nIn other words, the evidence provided in the article suggests that Hunter Biden indeed had no experience in Ukraine or the energy sector when he joined the board of Burisma, supporting Bondi's claim."

    "output": "Here's my evaluation:\n\n{'label': 'Supported', 'justification': 'Donald Trump did indeed sign the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017, which was the largest tax cut package since the Reagan administration in the 1980s. The bill reduced corporate tax rates from 35% to 21%, and limited individual income tax rates to a maximum of 37%. This is supported by credible sources, including news outlets like NPR and CNN.'}\n\nThe justification is based on my understanding that Donald Trump did indeed sign significant tax cuts into law during his presidency. I've relied on credible sources from reputable news organizations to support this claim."

The article supports this by stating that a task force recommended extending Affordable Care Act coverage to immigrants illegally in the country who are protected from deportation, and allowing additional immigrants to buy health insurance without financial assistance. This aligns with the claim.'}\n\nNote: The only part of the original claim that is not supported by the article is the mention of \"amnesty\", as the article does not explicitly state that Biden has pledged to provide amnesty to all illegal immigrants. However, the article does support the claims regarding health care and border wall construction."

The article specifically mentions that Evers urged people planning to protest to 'do so peacefully' in a video statement posted the next day.\"}\n\nThe justification is based on the conclusion from PolitiFact's fact-checking report, which states that Marklein's claim is Mostly False because Evers did call for peace and calm after the shooting."

Since the verdict states that one of the claims is correct, we can infer that this claim about 35% of revenue going to states is indeed supported by evidence.\"\n}\n```\n\nNote: I'm assuming that Raila Odinga's statement is based on credible sources and not just personal opinion."

This suggests that the claim is misleading and incorrect.'}`\n\nIn this case, the label is \"Refuted\" because the statement being made about Margaret Sanger's beliefs and goals is disputed by historians and scholars who have studied her life. The evidence presented refutes the claim that Sanger was a racist with a goal of eradicating minorities, suggesting instead that her opinions were concerned with public health in general rather than specific to race."

This information is presented as factual, without any contradictions or qualifications.\"\n}\n\nIn this case, the claim that Joe Biden voted for the Iraq War and supported war in Serbia, Syria, and Libya is classified as \"Supported\" because the text presents evidence to support each of these claims."
